  abstract = {In this paper, we explore degrees of freedom in deep sigmoidal neural networks. We show that the degrees of freedom in these models are related to the expected optimism, which is the expected difference between test error and training error. We provide an efficient Monte-Carlo method to estimate the degrees of freedom for multi-class classification methods. We show that the degrees of freedom is less than the parameter count in a simple XOR network. We extend these results to neural nets trained on synthetic and real data and investigate the impact of networkâ€™s architecture and different regularization choices. The degrees of freedom in deep networks is dramatically less than the number of parameters. In some real datasets, the number of parameters is several orders of magnitude larger than the degrees of freedom. Further, we observe that for fixed number of parameters, deeper networks have less degrees of freedom exhibiting a regularization-by-depth. Finally, we show that the degrees of freedom of deep neural networks can be used in a model selection criterion. This criterion has comparable performance to crossvalidation with lower computational cost.},

  abstract = {Food security for the 7 billion people on earth requires minimizing crop damage by timely detection of diseases. Most deep learning models for automated detection of diseases in plants suffer from the fatal flaw that once tested on independent data, their performance drops significantly. This work investigates a potential solution to this problem by using segmented image data to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) models. As compared to the F-CNN model trained using full images, S-CNN model trained using segmented images more than doubles in performance to 98.6\% accuracy when tested on independent data previously unseen by the models even with 10 disease classes. Not only this, by using tomato plant and target spot disease type as an example, we show that the confidence of self-classification for S-CNN model improves significantly over F-CNN model. This research work brings applicability of automated methods closer to non-experts for timely detection of diseases.},
