Artificial Intelligence for Tree Failure Identification and Risk Quantification

## Step 1: Label input data
Inputs are images (currently 3024 x 4032 pixels). These are currently saved locally and not accessible on the remote. Email the collaborators for data access. To perform labeling, run `process-image-files`.

## Step 2: Prototype CNN
The convolutional neural network and other image pre-processing are specified in `prototype-cnn.ipynb`.
